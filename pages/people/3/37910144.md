Keith graduated from Roger’s High School with the class of 1988, and went on to attend Northwestern Ohio University for their automotive program. He worked as an automotive technician at various dealerships and companies throughout his career. Keith was a kind, soft spoken man who would do anything for anyone. Always willing to help or lend a hand. He loved to hang out with friends and watch sports. Keith was a diehard University of Michigan and Detroit Lions fan. Survivors include his daughter, Andrea (Michael) Cooper; grandchildren, Abigail and Finnigan Cooper; sisters, Kim (Chad) Zylstra, Kelly (Larry) Barton, and Karrie (Jeff) Miller; and multiple nieces and nephews. Keith was preceded in death by his parents; his son, Ryan Allan Wilson; and the mother to Keith’s children, Michelle Rawdon. Per his wishes cremation has taken place. A celebration of life will take place on Saturday, June 28, 2025, from 12:00pm (Noon) until 5:00pm at Palmer Park (Shelter C), 1275 52nd Street SW, Wyoming, MI. The family would love to hear stories and memories you have about Keith and look forward to seeing you. The family would like to extend a special thank you to Keith’s sister, Kelly, brother-in-law, Chad, and other family and friends that helped and assisted in so many ways since his cancer diagnosis. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Cancer Society in Keith’s memory.
