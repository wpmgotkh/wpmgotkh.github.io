  > GRAND HAVEN, Mich., Jan 21 -- Edmund Wilson, aged 82 years, for 50 years a resident of Robinson township, died at Kalamazoo where he had made his home of late. He served in the New York heavy artillery during the Civil War. Much land in Allendale and Robinson townships was cleared by his ax. For years he served as sexton in Robinson, with scarcely any pay, digging graves by lantern light, so as not to interfere with his other work. He leaves two sons.
