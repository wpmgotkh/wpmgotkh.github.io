  > Ethan Chad Anthony Desero was born to Tony and Nicole (Zylstra) Desero on August 30, 2011 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Weighing in at 7lbs 1oz and measuring 19 ½ inches, Ethan soon became a powerhouse among his older brothers: Austin was three years older and Kyle was seven years older. At 18 months, he was driving around the house in his little police car and outdoors on a small quad. Needless to say, Ethan loved motor vehicles, and he especially liked to hear the roar of his grandpa’s Harley Davidson motorcycle. Yet, this “all-boy” toddler never went anywhere without his blanket “Night Night.”  
  >   
  > In 2012, the family moved to Vicksburg, Michigan, where Tony owned and  operated Crystal Carpet Care, and Nicole remained at Spectrum Health as a Nurse Assistant. To Ethan’s delight, the family often went camping. Recently, they had made a trip to Mackinac Island, and Ethan was thrilled to go on the boat ride. That’s how he enjoyed the lakes of Michigan—not on the beaches, because he didn't like getting sand on his feet.  
  >   
  > In general, Ethan loved being outside. Perhaps that’s why he preferred the color green. Then again, it may ave been because, when he found money, he would claim, “My money, honey!” Among other notable expressions, Ethan’s favorite was, “Go away.” He seemed to know what he wanted and pursued it with vigor. He liked Tootsie Rolls, cereal and chocolate milk. In fact, his parents were quite sure that he would drink a cow dry if he could.   
  >   
  > Ethan was fond of dogs and particularly fascinated with the neighbor’s dogs. He was known to stand at the window and bark at them. What a comic picture that must have been! Such a “character” gave endless joy and laughter to his parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Ethan will live in their hearts for life.  
  >
