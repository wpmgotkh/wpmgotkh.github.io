  > WILSON, GARY After a courageous battle against cancer, Gary Wilson, 66, passed away April 8, 2012, with his family by his side in Grand Rapids, MI. A memorial service will be held Thursday April 12, at 2:00 PM at the Grandville Conference Centre by Branns at 2900 Wilson Ave Granville, MI.

Mr. Wilson maintained a 45 year career that included sales in transportation and real estate. His career allowed him to foster many lifelong friendships that he valued always. His interests included fishing, attending numerous activities by his grandchildren with a special passion for golf. He was a long time member at his home course of North Kent Golf in Rockford, MI where he maintained many special relationships and where he recorded his only career hole in one. He was married on May 8, 1964 in Grand Rapids, MI to his high school sweetheart Sherry Evans.

A special thank you to Johnny and Sandy Brann and June and Jack Bouman for all your love and support during our time of need.
