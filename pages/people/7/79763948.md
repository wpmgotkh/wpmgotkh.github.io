  > Beatrice Wilson never needed or asked for much. As long as she had her family by her side and could enjoy the open spaces of the great outdoors, there was simply nothing else that could have pleased her more. A remarkable woman in the hearts of those she leaves behind, she will be lovingly missed and remembered.  
  >   
  > The decade of the 1920s forever changed the landscape of America. From prosperity to financial devastation, it was indeed a turning point in the history of our nation. The year 1922 in particular moved America in many new directions. Women won the right to vote, baseball was all the rage, the entertainment industry boomed and the wave of industrial expansion provided much for the American people. For William R. and Bessie A. (Kobel) Metzger, these days of plenty proved even brighter when on June 5, 1922 they welcomed the birth of their daughter, Beatrice into the their hearts.  
  >   
  > Born and raised in Allegan County near the community of Moline, Michigan, Beatrice was the only daughter in her family. Living in a rural area gave her an appreciation for the outdoors which was something she came to regard highly later in her life. Although she lived through the most difficult years of the Depression, her family got along okay despite the common struggles.  
  >   
  > Beatrice attended Moline Elementary School and was an outgoing and fun-loving girl. Throughout her school years she enjoyed the friendships of many, especially at Wayland High School where she participated in the Glee Club and sang in the choir before graduating in 1940. Following the death of her father, and shortly after she graduated, Beatrice and her mother moved to the Wyoming area of Michigan. They made their home on Stafford Street and before long she was able to secure a job at the General Motors Factory nearby.  
  >   
  > Some say fate works in mysterious ways, and for Beatrice, it certainly did. Soon after she began working at GM she met a fellow worker named Fletcher Wilson. A handsome young man, he seemed somewhat familiar. She remembered one day while still living in Moline how a kind truck driver offered her a ride while she was walking to school one day during a storm. Fate had once again crossed their paths as they both now worked at GM. Before long a romance developed and after falling deeply in love they were happily married on November 26, 1946 in a ceremony held in Grand Rapids.  
  >   
  > Beatrice and Fletcher settled into a house on Long Street in Wyoming where together they raised their five children, Marvin, Duane, Beatrice, Judy, and Bill. They spent countless times together as a family over the years making their house a home and where cherished memories were treasured. It remained Beatrice's home until it was eventually sold in 1991.  
  >   
  > A devoted wife and mother, Beatrice made a good home for her family. She liked canning and from her garden canned most of the food her family would enjoy throughout the year. Along with keeping house and looking after the children she was also talented when it came to crafts. She enjoyed keeping her hands busy crocheting and many of the projects she found pleasure in. Working on crossword puzzles was also another favorite pastime she enjoyed. She and Fletcher were active in several lodges where they became longtime friends with Freddie Angus and Frank Van Palt, just to mention a few. Beatrice was also a member of the White Shrine of Jerusalem and Job’s Daughters. Very active with these organizations, she was devoted in her service to their many activities.  
  >   
  > Eventually Beatrice and her husband purchased property up north on the Muskegon River and affectionately called it, "the farm". They spent most of their leisure time there sitting around the fire pit with the company of family and friends while enjoying one of their many pig roasts. Since her earliest years she loved the outdoors and appreciated all it had to offer. Enjoying the outdoors was something she and Fletcher found great happiness in. Together they liked fishing on the river as well as hunting. Self sufficient, they never had need for much. For a time they raised and sold rabbits, some of which made for great meals on their table. After about 20 years they decided to sell "the farm" and moved on to warmer ambitions.  
  >   
  > After their property on the river sold they purchased a home in Homosassa Springs, Florida where they enjoyed the warmer climate away from Michigan's harsh winters. They developed several wonderful friendships down south all while keeping very active and busy raising chickens. Once the weather warmed up, they returned to Michigan in their travel trailer to enjoy the summer months with friends and family. With no house to arrive home to, they often parked their trailer at one of their children's homes. A love for travel was simply something Beatrice and Fletcher enjoyed together, even prior to their retirement. Their travels took them across the U.S., Canada and to Mexico. After 30 years as a dedicated employee at GM, Beatrice's time to enjoy life and travel was well deserved.  
  >   
  > When her beloved husband passed away in 2001 Beatrice was at a loss. She remained in Michigan and usually stayed with one of her children. During this time Beatrice was able to slow down and enjoy being the loving mother and grandmother that she truly was. She had a few well loved sayings, like telling others to always "be careful" or her expression of, "take your time, but hurry back". Whenever she was getting ready to move with one of her other children, she was sure to firmly tell her grandchildren, "help your mother!" During the last few years Beatrice lived with her daughter and at times with several of her grandchildren. While living with her daughter, Beatrice recently became ill and sadly, at the age of 88, passed away on Sunday, April 3, 2011.  
  >   
  > To Beatrice, there was nothing quite like the love of family and being in the midst of their presence. She will be fondly remembered as a very loving and giving mother and grandmother who found joy in the outdoors.  
  >   
  > Along with her husband, Beatrice was preceded in death by her two sons: Marvin “Bud” Wilson, Duane Wilson; her daughter, Judy Jeske; son-in-law, Dennis Hartley. Surviving are her children: Beatrice Hartley, Bill (Judy) Wilson; 30 grandchildren; numerous great-grandchildren and great great-grandchildren; brothers and sister-in-law: Robert Metzger, Wayne and Ellen Hapner; several nieces and nephews. Funeral services will be held Thursday, 1:00 PM at the Heritage Life Story Funeral Home, Van Strien-Creston Chapel, 1833 Plainfield N.E. with interment to follow in Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens. Mrs. Wilson reposes at the funeral home where relatives and friends may meet her family on Tuesday, 7-9 PM and again Wednesday, 2-4 and 7-9 PM.
